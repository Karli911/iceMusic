To create a translation for this bot, i have made it convenient,
to be able to just copy the text within the "en.json" file in this directory
and simply edit what you want, or change if you want to be a bit quirky.
To make activate your newly made translation, just add the letters representing the language,
such as "en" for english, "ru" for russian, "fr" for french, and so on.
After doing this step, change the file extension from ".txt" to ".json", which would look like this,
"fr.json".
For any issues don't be shy and message me.
